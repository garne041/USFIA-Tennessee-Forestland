# USFIA-Tennessee-Forestland

The Forestry Inventory and Analysis program sponsored US Department of Agriculture is a publically available GIS dataset of the distribution of available wood species across the US. The forestry estimates are updated every year on a rolling basis. For wood, pulp, and paper industries, the ability to have updated information on forest population estimates allows companies in that sector to plan for sustainable forestry harvest with minimal negative environmental impact. 

In this project, I prepare the data for visualization with Python and visualize the cleaned geospatial data with Tableau. I focused on highlighting wood species distribution surrounding the 5 largest cities in Tennessee: Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Clarkesville, and Chattanooga. I've included the Python script and a link to the finished [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/TennesseeSpeciesDistribution/TNForestryDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
